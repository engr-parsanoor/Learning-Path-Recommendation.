# 📚 Learning Path Recommendation System

This project was completed as part of my Machine Learning Internship (Task 3).  
The goal was to build a recommendation system that suggests personalized learning paths to interns based on their performance and course data.

---

## 🚀 Project Description

Using collaborative filtering (SVD algorithm from `scikit-surprise`), the model predicts which courses are most suitable for interns, helping to tailor a better learning experience.

## 📂 Files Included

- `learning_path_recommender.ipynb` — Main notebook/code file
- `intern_performance.csv` — Performance data of interns
- `course_data.csv` — Course metadata
- `README.md` — This file

---

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-surprise

---

## 📈 How It Works

1. Load course and intern performance data.
2. Preprocess and structure data using `surprise.Reader` and `Dataset`.
3. Train an SVD model for recommendation.
4. Evaluate model accuracy and generate course suggestions.
